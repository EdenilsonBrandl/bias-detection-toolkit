Bias Detection Toolkit â€“ Machine Learning Techniques (Author & Developer)
Developed a comprehensive toolkit of advanced machine learning techniques for detecting and mitigating biases in data pipelines, model training, and deployment. The toolkit includes the following custom detectors:

Artificial Result Improvement Detector
Function: Identifies situations where results appear artificially improved due to overfitting, data leakage, or selective reporting.
Benefits: Ensures model integrity by flagging suspicious performance gains, reducing the risk of misleading insights and enhancing trustworthiness.

Audit Documentation Fraud Detector
Function: Detects inconsistencies and potential fraud in model audit trails and documentation.
Benefits: Strengthens compliance and accountability by verifying the authenticity of ML model audit records.

Bias Tagging Multilevel
Function: Performs multi-level tagging of bias sources across data preprocessing, feature engineering, and algorithmic design stages.
Benefits: Provides granular visibility of bias origins, facilitating targeted mitigation strategies.

Causal Matrix Decomposition Detector
Function: Analyzes causal matrices to uncover hidden relationships that may introduce bias into model predictions.
Benefits: Promotes causal fairness by revealing and correcting spurious dependencies.

Chronic Drift Detector
Function: Monitors for long-term distribution drift in data streams that can bias model predictions over time.
Benefits: Enhances model robustness and reduces degradation in predictive performance.

Constraint Queue Shift Detector
Function: Identifies shifts in operational constraints or task queues that could bias decision-making algorithms.
Benefits: Enables proactive adjustment of optimization algorithms to maintain fairness.

Contextual Input Variation Detector
Function: Flags contextual variations in input data that may disproportionately affect certain subgroups.
Benefits: Improves model generalization and reduces context-sensitive biases.

Downstream Variable Shadowing Detector
Function: Detects instances where downstream variables inadvertently override or mask critical signals, introducing bias.
Benefits: Prevents loss of important information and safeguards data lineage integrity.

Embedded Social Learning Effect Detector
Function: Identifies biases introduced by social learning behaviors embedded in feedback loops.
Benefits: Reduces self-reinforcing biases in adaptive systems.

Explainable Outlier with Hidden Cause Detector
Function: Detects outliers with underlying hidden causes, providing explainability for anomalous predictions.
Benefits: Supports transparent debugging of ML systems and improves fairness audits.

Manual Data Forgery Detector
Function: Detects tampering or manual alteration of datasets that could bias model outcomes.
Benefits: Strengthens data integrity and security protocols.

Masked Feedback Bias Detector
Function: Identifies hidden biases within feedback mechanisms that are masked by aggregated data.
Benefits: Improves the design of feedback loops and enhances fairness in adaptive systems.

Range Drift Without Breach Detector
Function: Detects subtle range drifts in data that occur without explicit threshold breaches.
Benefits: Enables early detection of creeping biases before they impact system performance.

Result Dependent Noise Detector
Function: Identifies noise in datasets that correlates with target variables, potentially biasing models.
Benefits: Improves signal-to-noise ratio and reduces model variance.

Selection Bias or Malintent Detector
Function: Detects biases introduced during sample selection or intentional manipulations.
Benefits: Safeguards against biased training datasets and malicious data curation.

Social Engineering Behavior Change Detector
Function: Flags instances where social engineering manipulates user behavior, impacting data distributions.
Benefits: Mitigates risks in systems exposed to adversarial user interactions.

Social Engineering Ignored Data Detector
Function: Identifies critical data points ignored due to adversarial social engineering tactics.
Benefits: Enhances model resilience against data omissions and manipulation.

Spurious Correlation Detector
Function: Detects non-causal correlations in datasets that can bias predictive models.
Benefits: Improves model interpretability and prevents overfitting to irrelevant features.

Synthetic Data Formula Detector
Function: Analyzes synthetic data generation formulas for potential embedded biases.
Benefits: Ensures synthetic datasets are representative and unbiased.

Theory of Constraints Variable Detector
Function: Identifies variables within ML pipelines constrained by systemic bottlenecks that may introduce bias.
Benefits: Supports optimization of ML workflows for fairness and efficiency.

Trauma Adaptive Source Detector
Function: Detects data patterns influenced by trauma-adaptive behaviors in source populations.
Benefits: Promotes ethical handling of sensitive data and fairness for affected populations.

Trigger Pattern Disruption Detector
Function: Flags disruptions in trigger patterns that bias reactive systems.
Benefits: Improves the stability and fairness of real-time adaptive algorithms.
